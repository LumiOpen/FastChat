The map() method takes a list of column names and a list of column values, and maps each value in the list to the corresponding column in the dataframe.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned, the `DataFrame` object has no attribute `map`, so you cannot use the `.map()` method directly. However, there are other ways to achieve the same result. For example, you can use the `.map(lambda x: x.mean())` or the `df.groupby(['age', 'name']).agg(['mean'])` methods. These methods will compute the mean of each column and map it to the `mean` column in the dataframe.","multilingual_3":"1"}

For example, to map from the \"column1\" column to the \"column2\" column, you can use the following code:\n\ndf.apply(lambda x: x.map(lambda col1, col2: col1 + col2, [\"column1\", \"column2\"]))\n\nIn this example, the df variable is a DataFrame, and the apply() method is used to apply the mapping function (lambda x: x.map(lambda col1, col2: col1 + col2, [\"column1\", \"column2\"])) to each row in the df DataFrame. The apply() method takes a list of functions, and the mapping function is applied to each row in the DataFrame. The result of this operation is a new DataFrame with the mapping functions applied to each row in the original DataFrame.\n\nTo use this method, you need to have a DataFrame object and a list of mapping functions. For example, if you want to map the \"column1\" column to the \"column2\" column, you can create a DataFrame df1 with two columns - \"column1\" and \"column2\". You can also create a list of mapping functions, like this:\n\nmapping_functions = [lambda x: x[\"column1\"] + x[\"column2\"], lambda x: x[\"column1\"] + x[\"column3\"], [\"column1\", \"column2\", \"column3\"])\ndf1.apply(lambda x: df1.map(lambda x: x.map(lambda col1, col2: col1 + col2, mapping_functions)))\nIn this example, the apply() method is used to apply the mapping functions to each row in the DataFrame df1. The apply() method takes a list of functions, and the mapping function is applied to each row in the DataFrame. The result of this operation is a new DataFrame with the mapping functions applied to each row in the original DataFrame.\n\nThis method is useful when you have a list of mapping functions and you want to apply them to each row in a DataFrame. However, if you only have a single column and you want to map it to another column, you will need to create a new DataFrame with a single column, which is not an option with the apply() method.","multilingual_3":"1"}
