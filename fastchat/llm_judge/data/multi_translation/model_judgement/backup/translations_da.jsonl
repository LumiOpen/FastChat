This method takes a function that maps each row in the original DataFrame to a row in the summary table, and an index vector specifying the column from which to start mapping.\n\nHere's an example of how you can map from the first column to the second column in a DataFrame:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame with two columns\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'b': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]})\n\n# Map first column to the second column\ndf.map(lambda x: x[0], 'b')\n```\nIn this example, the 'map' method takes a function that maps each row in the original DataFrame to a row in the summary table, and an index vector specifying the column from which to start mapping. The function in this case maps each row in the first column to the second column in the summary table.\n\nYou can also map columns using a DataFrame.map() method, which takes a list of functions that map each column in the original DataFrame to a column in the summary table, and an index vector specifying the column from which to start mapping.","multilingual_3":"2"}

The goal of DataFrame is to summarise the contents of multiple tables into a single table, and this cannot be achieved by mapping one column of one DataFrame to another column of another DataFrame. To map between columns in a DataFrame, you need to use the `map` method on the DataFrame object. For example, if you have a DataFrame with two columns, x and y, you could use the `map` method to create a new column, z, such that z=df[df['x'] > df['y'], df['y'].sum(1)]. This new column, z, will contain the values of column y for rows of the DataFrame where column x is greater than column y.","multilingual_3":"2"}
