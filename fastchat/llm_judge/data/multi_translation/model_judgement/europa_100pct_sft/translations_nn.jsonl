However, the DataFrame object has no attribute called `map`, so you cannot directly map from one column to another like you did previously. The following code will show you how to map from one column to another in a DataFrame:\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n                  'b': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\n                  'c': [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]})\n\n# map column 'A' to column 'C'\ndf['C'] = df['A'].map(lambda x: x + 5)\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `map` method to map the column 'A' to the column 'C'. The `map` method takes a function and a column in the DataFrame and returns a new DataFrame with the columns in the DataFrame and the columns in the function. In this example, we use the lambda function to map the 'A' column to the 'C' column. The `map` method is a shortcut for the following code:\n\n```\ndf['C'] = df['A'].map(lambda x: x + 5)\n```\n\nSo, the final result of the code is a DataFrame with two columns: 'C' and 'A', where 'C' is the column that we map from 'A', and 'A' is the column of the dataframe that we map to 'C'.","multilingual_3":"0","multilingual_2":0.0,"multilingual-e5-large":0.9087417722}

The function `map_nynorske_kolonne_to_andre` takes a dataframe of strings as input and loops through each element in the dataframe. For each element, the function calls the `map` method, passing in a function that returns a string for each column in the dataframe. The resulting array of strings is then joined together using the `join` method and converted to a new column in the dataframe. Finally, the resulting dataframe is appended to the table using the `append` method. The `map_nynorske_kolonne_to_andre` function can be used as a starting point for further customization based on specific needs.","multilingual_3":"2","multilingual_2":0.0,"multilingual-e5-large":0.8465444446}
