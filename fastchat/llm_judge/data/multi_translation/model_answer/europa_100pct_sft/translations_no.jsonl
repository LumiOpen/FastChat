It involves converting data from one format to another, often with the help of specialized functions, templates, or libraries. Here are the steps to perform mapping between columns in R:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries:\n```R\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n2. Define the data frame:\n```R\ndata(iris, package = \"vegan\")\n```\n\n3. Use the dplyr package to create a data frame with two columns:\n```R\nhead(iris, 3)\n```\nThis will give you the first, second, and third columns of the data frame.\n\n4. Use the ggplot2 package to create a plot of the two columns:\n```R\nggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal, y = Petal)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\nThis will create a box plot of the two columns, where Sepal and Petal are the input and output variables, respectively. The mapping function aes(x = Sepal, y = Petal) assigns each observation in the data frame a unique label, which can be used to create plots like the one above.\n\n5. To map the two columns to another format, you can use the pd() function to convert the data frame into a data series. For example, here's how to create a data series of the two columns, where Sepal and Petal are the input and output variables, respectively:\n\n```R\nhead(iris, 3) %>%\n  pd(Sepal, var = \"Sepal\", col = col)\nhead(iris, 3) %>%\n  pd(Petal, var = \"Petal\", col = col)\n```\nYou can use the pd() function to convert the data frame into a data series of two columns, where Sepal and Petal are the input and output variables, respectively.\n\n6. Finally, you can merge the two columns back into a single data frame using the merge() function, which takes a list of data frames as input. For example, here's how to merge the two columns into a single data frame, where Sepal and Petal are the input and output variables, respectively:\n\n```R\nhead(iris, 3) %>%\n  merge(Sepal, Petal)\nhead(iris, 3) %>%\n  merge(Sepal, Petal, by = c(\"id\", \"col\"))\n```\n\nThis will merge the two columns into a single data frame, where Sepal and Petal are the input and output variables, respectively. The merge() function takes a list of data frames as input, so you can use it to merge multiple data frames into a single data frame with multiple columns.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to perform mapping between columns in R.
